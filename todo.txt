1 april sat

create kg_52_88

analyse dynamic embeddings with topic modeling (skeleton code)
nb -> py + mechanics

day full of reading + brainstorming


2 april sun
day full of reading + brainstorming

readings & brainstorming
creative day full of analysis, new ideas
rest of readings & brainstorming hugely: spread info, avoid document dominance
sort this page


ml interviews
ml design c (all)
ml desing d (all)
plan next week


readings:social, nlp
ultimate goals: movement of persons (person importance over time), allies/enemies of countries

mechanics: nb -> py, add family members
-rename analysis.py to topic_extraction.py
-transfer doc topic info merging in analysis.ipynb to analysis.py
-rename analysis.ipynb to experiment.ipynb
-rename city_eda.ipynb to city_country_extraction.py (use input("Press Enter to continue..."))
-rename basic_extraction.ipynb to document_extraction.py
-merge wikidata_querying and person_unify
-single venv
-relocate all files under src folder
-rename wikidata_querying.ipynb to extract_person_extras.ipynb
-change city and country name extensions within the code
-use multiprocessing for doc_extraction
-no ne2vec folder
-rename sentiment_analysis.ipynb to entity_sentiment_extraction.ipynb
-create new file name lda_topic_extraction.py from analysis.ipynb



brainstorming 1:
1-think on interesting research questions
2-think on overleaf + paper notes
3-think on nlp + gds application on our KG specifically
4-think on pure nlp for analysis

brainstorming 2:
political QA
obtain instutions from frus
keyword based topic/document search, seeing document relating to 'food', or doing sth with it
adding region to countries, and dealing with region specific issues (running dynamic topic model for Turkey)
supervised dummy task
forcefully community detection
do sth with keywords and their embeddings, and their similarities?
how do analysis get affected when no person annotation is available ?
country mention count over time graph (simple but meaningful statistics)
start using edge weight (similarity measure, sentiment)?
only include countries for the sentiment analysis?
which topics turkey mentioned in over time? greece -> saudi arabia e.g.(for which topics countries become closer? add sentiment?)
political word embeddings type named entity embeddings
merge keywords with ne but this time not on countvectorizer for ke
adding keywords to KG as well (meaningful keywords from phrase extractor), store their embeddings as well where edge weight is mutual similarity
adding named entities to KG as well
adding document/paragraph sentiment to KG as well
adding sentiments to kg for 2nd goal?
including the sentence of paragraph redaction is in OR extracting amount of redaction
how to handle histroical countries? 
node embeddings from gds + doc2vec + bump chart as proof of concept
entity linking, then person->political view
co-reference resolution? neuralcoref by huggingface
source requires more processing
handle person who are not annotated with persName tag
threshold on cosine similarities for wikidata matching
increase cosine similarity threshold for sbert wikidata description match
replace abbr within text with full
using person, country, institution descriptions from wikipedia ?
sentence or paragraph level semantics and their projection and evaluation in space ?
