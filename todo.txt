DONE-initial kg construction
DONE-make sure person sent to list values can map to person nodes
DONE- city match. how to automatize? finish processing for 2 era
DONE- fetch country url's and unify country names
DONE- unified persons into KG + 2 presidential era KG construction
DONE- read on importing wikidata into neo4j for Country
DONE-texts -> sql, sql id -> KG
DONE-wikidata extra information
DONE-finding redactions (format etc.), integrate KG

feb 22
dynamic topic modelling + insert topics into KG 9-12
run pagerank 13-15
columbia ner 15-16
keyword+named entity node embeddings 20-23

simple aspect based sentiment analysis



reading after meeting

using several levels of topics as assigned to a document (general -> specific)
extract some keywords as well using keybert
get texts directly from text_69_76.db

promising low hanging fruits:
simple aspect based sentiment analysis
keyword+named entity KG projection with node2vec on top

person description clustering ??
named entity extraction combined with topic modeling


add family members, party school country, party ideology
creative day full of analysis (cypher, plots, algos)
nb -> py


readings:
1-nlp readings
2-social readings

brainstorming:
1-think on interesting research questions
2-think on overleaf + paper notes
3-think on nlp + gds application on our KG specifically
4-think on pure nlp for analysis

keyword extraction?
using person, country, institution descriptions from wikipedia ?
WHY DOES KG STAY THERE IF WE CAN USE ONLY NLP? answer this! -> for using GDS
sentence or paragraph level semantics and their projection and evaluation in space ?

emotion detection
ner, NORP, ORG

#todo
including the sentence of paragraph redaction is in OR extracting amount of redaction
how to handle histroical countries? 
node embeddings from gds + doc2vec + bump chart as proof of concept
entity linking, then person->political view
co-reference resolution? neuralcoref by huggingface
source requires more processing
handle person who are not annotated with persName tag
threshold on cosine similarities for wikidata matching
increase cosine similarity threshold for sbert wikidata description match
replace abbr within text with full

+improvements on city matching:
first check if capital or big city if not found check human settlement -done
process cities by batch so San jose can match with san jose, costa rica -todo
each processed city will be base for upcoming ones -todo
watch out Santiago	Dominican Republic -todo
Sofia,Madagascar -done
consider having countryLabel and countryTag in a separate df for all countries
Republic of Vietnam and vietnam
ireland and republic of ireland

+improvements on person matching:
matching more with sentence similarity, also reducing multi wiki matches with sentence similarity
if same name person appear more than one, select the one with most occurances!
warning: ahmed ben saleh X ahmed ben bella


#design
for person_mentioned, included all persName tags regardless of in title, text, or closer except ones within note tag
