17 march Fri
1- increase KG (nb -> py + mechanics) 13-16
2- dynamic ne2vec for 69_76 2 year bins (proof of concept) 16-16.30
3- mix dynamic embeddings with topic modeling  (skeleton code) 18.30-19.30
4- degree centrality some are 0. check it. 20-..
5- only include roles with start, and year ..-21
tf developer certificate 21-00

18 march Sat
0- one political paper reading
1- add ne and their sentiment to KG -only using sentiments for ne that will be used in ne2vec?-
2- readings & brainstorming hugely: spread info, avoid document dominance
3- obtain instutions from frus 
4- dynamic lda

19 march Sun
1- prepare slides





some results about ultimate goals before historian meeting
creative day full of analysis
sort this page

readings:social, nlp
ultimate goals: movement of persons (person importance over time), allies/enemies of countries

mechanics: nb -> py, add family members
-rename analysis.py to topic_extraction.py
-transfer doc topic info merging in analysis.ipynb to analysis.py
-rename analysis.ipynb to experiment.ipynb
-rename city_eda.ipynb to city_country_extraction.py
-rename basic_extraction.ipynb to document_extraction.py
-merge wikidata_querying and person_unify
-single venv
-relocate all files under src folder



brainstorming 1:
1-think on interesting research questions
2-think on overleaf + paper notes
3-think on nlp + gds application on our KG specifically
4-think on pure nlp for analysis

brainstorming 2:
country mention count over time graph (simple but meaningful statistics)
start using edge weight (similarity measure, sentiment)?
only include countries for the sentiment analysis?
which topics turkey mentioned in over time? greece -> saudi arabia e.g.(for which topics countries become closer? add sentiment?)
political word embeddings type named entity embeddings
merge keywords with ne but this time not on countvectorizer for ke
adding keywords to KG as well (meaningful keywords from phrase extractor), store their embeddings as well where edge weight is mutual similarity
adding named entities to KG as well
adding document/paragraph sentiment to KG as well
adding sentiments to kg for 2nd goal?
including the sentence of paragraph redaction is in OR extracting amount of redaction
how to handle histroical countries? 
node embeddings from gds + doc2vec + bump chart as proof of concept
entity linking, then person->political view
co-reference resolution? neuralcoref by huggingface
source requires more processing
handle person who are not annotated with persName tag
threshold on cosine similarities for wikidata matching
increase cosine similarity threshold for sbert wikidata description match
replace abbr within text with full
using person, country, institution descriptions from wikipedia ?
sentence or paragraph level semantics and their projection and evaluation in space ?
