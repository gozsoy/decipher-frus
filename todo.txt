DONE-initial kg construction
DONE-make sure person sent to list values can map to person nodes
DONE- city match. how to automatize? finish processing for 2 era
DONE- fetch country url's and unify country names
DONE- unified persons into KG + 2 presidential era KG construction
DONE- read on importing wikidata into neo4j for Country
DONE-texts -> sql, sql id -> KG

feb 2
topic modeling 9-12.30 topics over time +keybert + lda possibilities again!
topic semantics should be continous not discrete
wikidata extraction for kg expansion 13.30-17.30 (use as much of extra info as possible to create a knowledge base)
run 1 gds algo regardless of being meaningful
kg analysis+brainstorming 19-23

think of persons and countries and their information extracted from wikidata+embeddings already a complete projection of real world
where the additional insight will be given by frus
trying the understand relationships with semantics
creative day full of analysis (cypher, plots, algos)


redactions
nb -> py
replace abbr within text with full


readings:
1-nlp readings
2-social readings

brainstorming:
1-think on interesting research questions
2-think on overleaf + paper notes
3-think on nlp + gds application on our KG specifically
4-think on pure nlp for analysis

keyword extraction?
using person, country, institution descriptions from wikipedia ?
WHY DOES KG STAY THERE IF WE CAN USE ONLY NLP? answer this! -> for using GDS
sentence or paragraph level semantics and their projection and evaluation in space ?

emotion detection

#todo
node embeddings from gds + doc2vec + bump chart as proof of concept
entity linking, then person->political view
co-reference resolution?
source requires more processing
handle person who are not annotated with persName tag

+improvements on city matching:
first check if capital or big city if not found check human settlement -done
process cities by batch so San jose can match with san jose, costa rica -todo
each processed city will be base for upcoming ones -todo
watch out Santiago	Dominican Republic -todo
Sofia,Madagascar -done
consider having countryLabel and countryTag in a separate df for all countries
Republic of Vietnam and vietnam
ireland and republic of ireland

+improvements on person matching:
matching more with sentence similarity, also reducing multi wiki matches with sentence similarity
if same name person appear more than one, select the one with most occurances!


#design
for person_mentioned, included all persName tags regardless of in title, text, or closer except ones within note tag
