#plan
DONE-initial kg construction
DONE-make sure person sent to list values can map to person nodes
a-10 years of data kg construction
    make sure persons and instutions unified across volumes, how?

import wikidata into neo4j for country (city->country)
entity linking, then person->political view
named entity recognition
co-reference resolution?

#challenges
personId is unique within volume, not series: think on how to merge series-wide
handle person who are not annotated with persName tag
how to get instution names
source requires more processing

#design
for person_mentioned, included all persName tags regardless of in title, text, or closer except ones within note tag
