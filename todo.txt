#plan
DONE-initial kg construction
DONE-make sure person sent to list values can map to person nodes

jan 4
1- unify persons across volumes -> maybe via wikidata (how to search wikidata)
2- read on importing wikidata into neo4j for country (city->country)
3- cypher exemplary queries via reaching KG from python
4- 2 presidential era KG construction
    

entity linking, then person->political view
named entity recognition
co-reference resolution?

#challenges
personId is unique within volume, not series: think on how to merge series-wide
handle person who are not annotated with persName tag
how to get instution names
source requires more processing

#design
for person_mentioned, included all persName tags regardless of in title, text, or closer except ones within note tag
